That's one honking big protein
Here is the cleavage
Down here is the bad zone

Your UI will eventually become racist
It can do it itself
or like guitar when you I don't know press a string then the music comes out
let's say you are playing the key of D, so that's one key you push down, 
or if you're on the guitar you just...

days, everyone codes in Python such as in places like Google.
So in front of him I whipped out my phone and rang one of my good friends who works at Google
and asked him "do you code in Java?"
Oh no! Oh this time I did it *looks at permanent marker* I'll have to come in tomorrow to fix this
